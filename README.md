# Prediction of Breast Cancer

See the notebook of this project [here](breast_cancer_preddiction.ipynb)

## 1. Description

In this project, I performed a supervised Machine Learning task of Classification using several algorithms, what allowed us to obtain a good model that predicts if the digitalized image of a breast mass corresponds to a diagnostic of cancer or not. I considered a dataset of creast cancer diagnostics of the Wisconsin hospital that is available publically, but the techniques can be applied to predict breast cancer from other dataset.

## 2. Tools

The tools used were Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn), Jupyter Notebook, and Github (version control). We used Statistics for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning algorithms of Classification.

## 3. Project objectives

**Problem statement:**

A hospital wants to study what characteristics of the digitalized images of breast mass corresponds to breast cancer and wants to predict the cancer based on the digitalized images.

For this, they have a dataset with information of almost 570 digitalized images. So, the project objectives is to develope models to predict breast cancer.

## 4. Solution

First, I did an Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset. 

After I used several Machine Learning algorithms for Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, Naive-Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LigthGBM, Catboost) to predict breast cancers.

## 5. Result

We implemented several Machine Learning models, and the best performance was obtained for LigthGBM. We summarize the performances in the following pictures:
